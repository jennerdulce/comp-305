# Markdown Notes

- 3 IDEs: small changes, real IDEs, batteries and not included
  - Webstorm is JetBrains JavaScript based
- read documentation

## Terminal

- use of flags
- --help
- -l => long
- -a => all

- `man`= manual
- man cd
- man ls

## Markdown

- Supposed to be easier
- Main form of documentation for programs .md files
- Flexibility of markdown can lead to design flaws since things are loose, structure may not be stable
