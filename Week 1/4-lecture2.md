# Lecture 2

## Software Engineering

- Encompasses everything, big, super complicated
- Business models, cultural issues, continuous integration, deciding tools and technologies, and shipping
- Building
  - plumbing, electical, hvac, etc
- Goal: Be aware of all things
- HTML, HTTP, CSS, JavaScript, Clients / Servers
- SWEBOC

1. Design (the tough part)
  - Instinct
  - Risk and Reward
2. Production
3. Chaos
  - Cannot account for luck



## Software Architecture

- Decisions you make in terms of materials you're going to use and how you're going to assemble it
- Webapp, client side vs server side.
- i.e. building a building, what materials, how are we going to build it etc.
  - Efficiency, performance, readability, interface, reusability
  - Spaghetti vs Non Spaghetti
  - Simple is better
  - Manage Complexity
    - Not try to have a million moving parts
      - i.e. NPM downloads a bunch of libraries / tools to make development of your program easier. Do not download too many
    - 1. Inherent: given a particular problem, inherit complexities to that problem
      - Inherent the problem
    - 2. Solution / Situational
- CI/CD pipeline
- Planning then code

## Misc

- Why are we concerned about not being good enough
- Is a sense of it good enough?
- Do not worry about complexity
  - I can figure it out if i need to
  - What problem is it solving for me
    - If you don't know, it does not improve your confidence level
  - 

## Talk About AI

- It is a good tool
- Cannot evaluate AI yet

### Boosters

- Huge trouble and economic collapse if this is true
- If you increase data, then gold comes out
