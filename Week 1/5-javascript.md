# JavaScript

## Why JavaScript

- JS is the only reasonable language to use with web development


## Sharp Edges

- Weak Typing
- Scoping
- Unfamiliar OOP
- Functional Style Underneath
- Asynchronous Coding
  - Will return with data at a later (soonish) time.
  - Closures
- Lack of programming in the large at first
- **Where it works will be the biggest problem we will face**
- JavaScript are the verbs
- HTML are the nouns

## JavaScript Environments

- Server Side Host Environment - NodeJS
- Client-Side Host Environment - Browsers and WebViews
- Browser based app running code
- Electron JSS
  - Container / copy of chrome, running your webpage

  ## Declaring Variables

  ```js


  ```

  ## Composite Types

```javascript
school = []
school[0] = 1;
school[1] = 's';
console.log(school)
```

## Memory Collection

- Intensive task; will affect you
- Will affect browser response times
- need to `null` variables to post for garbage collection
- array is a ordered collection of stuff
- object is unordered collection of stuff
