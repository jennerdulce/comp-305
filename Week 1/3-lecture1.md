# Lecture 1

- Systematic application of scientific and technological knowledge, methods, and experience to the deisgn, implementation, testing, and documentation of software
    - Systematic
    - Disciplined
    - Quantifiable
    - Efficient

- Design engineering part is harder
    - Knowing what to build appears to be the much harder part
    - Things are hard if design is wrong

- **Lots of complexity**
- Is UI and UX a software engineering topic? **Yes**
  - We understand that we need specalists to do certain jobs

- Software engineering: Multidisciplinary

- SWEBOK: 
- What is swebok

- Big picture: How the components and systems fit together
    - Choices you have to make
    - ex. Single page web application using react? or mobile application written in swift
    - ex. Monolithic approach or using many microservices?

- Software Architecture is highly Situational
    - Dream up situations where one choice might work and where one wouldnt
    - Think of different roofs built in different countries
    - There is no one size fits all

## Software Design

- Midlevel planning

### Design patterns

- Patterns represent common and well considered solutions to common problems
- The are importnat but first **understand the problem**
- **Start with the problem, end with the solution**

- Premature abstraction, copying or using the same software and strategies that other use

### What matters

- We need to know how to code, think, communicate, type speed, grinding 996 style
- SWE is bigger than programming
    - Go beyond programming
- Difference of opinion? or does it really matter?
- Think about people

### Homework

- Programmers: stop callng yourselves engineers the atlantic
    - Write a response in Markdown
