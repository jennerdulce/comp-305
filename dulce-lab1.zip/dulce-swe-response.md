In the article, *“Programmers: Stop Calling Yourselves Engineers Response”* by Ian Bogost, Bogost makes a great point about how society has become complacent in deeming one as an “engineer.”

## The Title

I most **definitely** agree with Ian. Ian proves a good point that traditional engineers often go through rigorous training and years of refining their craft. Learning disciplines and practices that have been passed on that led to the reputation that it carries which is admirable in the most prestigious ways. In addition to Ian’s insights, during the computer science wave that took over during the times of covid epidemic in 2020, ignorant individuals from entirely different fields flooded the gates with little to no prior experience. While the title “engineer” was appropriate for few, it is obvious that there is a misconception of the term “engineer,” as these individuals bypassed the hard work that engineers often go through that cannot. I found Ian’s frustrations reasonable, as novice developers would soon claim the title of “engineer” or “computer engineer” within less than a year of training.

## Comparing Software Development and Engineering

Software development and engineering are different disciplines and should not be intertwined with each other. Software development's motto of ***"move fast, break things"*** alone goes against engineerring principles In the article, Ian identifies how the work of software developers often contain errors and mistakes due to the type of infrastructure of coding and can be easily resolved by quick fixes or “patches.” Whereas engineers cannot afford these so many mistakes without suffering catastrophic consequences.

Although the initial practices of software development seemed to approach problems closely to engineering. Nowadays, the actual work of development is closer related to financial and business rather than engineering due to the fact that applications are built to scale and profit from.

Mainly, software development has devolved from its previous crediability for 2 reasons:

1. Deadlines that would lead to unfinished and lackluster products
2. Software is self centered and isolated
